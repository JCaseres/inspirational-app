INP (Inspirational Note Pad) is my first REACT application built by me after I took a REACT online course to learn the language. I was never introduced to REACT in my four years at DeVry in 2011 because REACT was still new back then, and only a few developers applied it to their sites. I took on the challenge of learning REACT through Codecademy, and after a few months of studying and reading, I finally created my first app. I look forward to learning more and increasing my knowledge of REACT to build bigger and better applications.
